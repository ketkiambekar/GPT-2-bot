# ResiBot
A GPT-2 based Chat Bot that resides in the year 2032 (pretend). 
Resi Bot is a text generator bot that was a part of Resilience2032 project that took place in September 2020. This project was a thought experiment on how our world will look like in the year 2032. It explored a variety of issues related to racism, sexism, climate, etc and sought to answer what steps we could take to mitigate these issues. It was anticipated that AI bots would be prolific around that time, and the ResiBot was developed to play the role of the contemporary AI. The bot is trained on a corpus curated by the writers' team of Resilience2032 to generate text that produced the effect of being in the year 2032.
